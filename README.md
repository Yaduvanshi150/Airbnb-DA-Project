Data Analysis on Airbnb Project
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of a cleaned Airbnb dataset, featuring over 55,000 listings from major cities. The aim is to identify meaningful patterns to guide better business decisions and enhance the guest experience. Key variables examined include property and room types, pricing, host responsiveness, cancellation policies, review counts, and location data.

The analysis highlights a strong preference for entire homes and real beds, with apartments being the most commonly listed property type. Listings priced under $100 and hosts with high response rates indicate a focus on affordability and reliability. Additionally, features like instant booking and high review scores are associated with increased guest engagement.

An interactive Tableau dashboard summarizes over 40 key insights and 6 strategic conclusions. It is designed to support decision-making, improve occupancy rates, and guide host onboarding and pricing strategies. This report is ideal for business teams, marketers, or data enthusiasts seeking to optimize Airbnbâ€™s operations.
